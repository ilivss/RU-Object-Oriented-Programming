# RU-Object-Ortiented-Programming

This repository contains all exercises from the course Object Oriented Programming at Radboud University. ALl exercises are written in Java.

Here is a list of design patterns I had to implement:
 -  Visitor Pattern
       Assignment of week 11 (Logical Formulas)

 -  MVC Pattern
       Assignment of week 9 (Snake Game)

 -  Observer Pattern
       Assignment of week 8 (Pie Chart)

 -  Active Class design pattern (Java Concurrency)
       Assignments of week 14 (Taxi) and week 15 (Supermarket)


Furthermore we learned a few other small design patterns during the lectures that I used during in the assignments:

 -  Optional Pattern
       Replace null by an Optional type. The optional object is always there.

 -  Singleton Pattern
       Only one instance of a certain class at a time. Constructor is private. Static attribute and method hold and save the object respectively.

 -  Strategy Pattern
       Define an interface that is an abstraction of the algorithm. Actual strategy classes implement this interface type. Whenever the algorithm needs to be executed the context class calls the appropriate method of the strategy object.

 -  Decorator Pattern
       Define an interface type that is an abstraction of the component. Actual component classes implement this interface . Decorator object manages the component object.
